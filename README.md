Sample for [Matthias Bohlen](https://mbohlen.de)'s 
[Domain-Driven Design class](https://mbohlen.de/domain-driven-design-cpsa-a/)
(iSAQB Advanced Level).

It is a small application to rent movies for a few days, watch them inside a
browser, and be billed for this.

Kind of "poor man's Netflix".

It demonstrates how to design such a thing using DDD, and how to implement it in TypeScript
on NodeJS, using the principles of the "ports and adapters" architectural style, as described by
Alistair Cockburn.
